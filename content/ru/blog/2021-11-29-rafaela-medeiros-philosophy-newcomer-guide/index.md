At Finec MGIMO we believe in long-term value of humanities as well as structured thinking and reasoning skills that philosophy provides. We are happy to have Dr. Medeiros to share her 
insights and passion about Philosophy of Science and practicality of learning philosopy for today's students.

In the interview look for "yes" and "no" of whether philosophy of science is relevant today, the great four of the discipline (Hume, Kant, Popper and Kuhn), implications of Popper-Kuhn debate in the 20th century and what are humans bad at as a species. Also check out great  reading suggestions from Rafaela and her solid advice on importance of your inner compass
and ways to calibrate it.
