Dr. Medeiros research interests are public policy, elections, social science methods, causal inference and data science. She has presented her research at APSA, IPSA and EGAP and has worked as a Consultant for UNDP at the Brazilian Ministry of Social Development. She is also the founder of Women in Machine Learning and Data Science Chapter in Rio (WiMLDS-Rio). She practices open water swimming and likes outdoor activities.   
     
At Finec MGIMO we believe in long-term value of humanities as well as structured thinking and reasoning skills that philosophy provides. We are happy to have Dr. Medeiros to share her 
insights and passion about Philosophy of Science and practicality of learning philosopy for today's students, including domains like economics, finance, management and business technology.

Look for "yes" and "no" of a question if philosophy of science relevant today, the great four of the discipline (Hume, Kant, Popper and Kuhn) and implications of Popper-Kuhn debate on pluralism of science in the 20th century and why it is relevant. Also great books as reading suggestions and firm advice on importance of your inner compass for decision-making.
